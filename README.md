# introduction
This is a simple Simon Says game, which I built as my first web development mini-project.

# how the game works
The game features four buttons, each of which blinks randomly during each round. The user must press the buttons in a specific sequence, which depends on the pattern of blinks from previous rounds.
If the user makes an error in the sequence, they must start over. Itâ€™s an exciting and challenging memory game!
